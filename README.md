# Daria Germash CV

# This project is my CV. I am applying for position of Junior / Intern Front-End Developer. I have knowledge and 8-year experience in html and css (sass) mark-up and strong base in JS. I keep learning, improving my hard skills and I am opened for collaboration as freelancer.

In recent years I worked as Graphic Designer and took part in commercial and volunteer projects as Web Developer. Now I have a goal to make my JavaScript knowledge much stronger, to raise the quality of markup and learn React.js
(There is my portfolio in this website and I keep on update it. I keep working hard to fill it with new projects of higher quality.)

I am based in West Flanders in Belgium and study Dutch intensively however keep on upgrade my English.
Your feedback is very important for me.
